- **AC 1.1.4**: Given I have created a root task, when I view the project, then I should see the task displayed in the task tree with correct WBS code
- **AC 1.1.5**: Given I am creating a root task, when I set optional fields (description, priority, dates, estimated hours), then these values should be saved and displayed correctly

#### Definition of Done:
- [ ] Task creation form validates required fields
- [ ] Root tasks are assigned sequential WBS codes (1, 2, 3...)
