## Executive Summary

Sprint 2 introduces a comprehensive Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) task management system to the Nobody Logger platform. This feature enables users to organize complex projects into hierarchical task structures with up to 3 levels of depth, providing structured project management capabilities with visual task trees, progress tracking, and comprehensive metadata management.

## Business Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Structured Project Management**: Enable users to break down complex projects into manageable, hierarchical task structures
2. **Progress Visibility**: Provide clear visual representation of project progress across all task levels
3. **Resource Planning**: Support time estimation and actual hours tracking for better resource allocation
4. **Task Prioritization**: Allow users to set and visualize task priorities for effective workflow management

### Success Metrics
- Task creation rate: Target 50+ tasks created per active user per month
- User engagement: 80% of users with projects create at least one WBS task
- Task completion rate: 70% of created tasks reach completed status within their estimated timeframe
- User satisfaction: 4.5/5 stars in user feedback surveys

## Target Users

### Primary Users
- **Project Managers**: Need structured approach to break down complex projects
- **Individual Contributors**: Require organized task hierarchy for personal productivity
- **Team Leaders**: Need visibility into task progress and resource allocation

### User Personas
- **Sarah (Project Manager)**: Manages multiple projects with complex deliverables, needs clear task hierarchy and progress tracking
- **Mike (Developer)**: Works on technical projects, needs detailed task breakdown with time estimation
- **Lisa (Consultant)**: Handles client projects with multiple phases, requires priority management and progress visibility

## Feature Overview

### Core Capabilities
1. **3-Level Task Hierarchy**: Support for Root (Level 1), Sub-task (Level 2), and Detail (Level 3) tasks
2. **WBS Code Generation**: Automatic hierarchical numbering system (e.g., 1.2.3)
3. **Complete CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete functionality for all tasks
4. **Visual Tree Structure**: Interactive tree view with expand/collapse functionality
5. **Comprehensive Metadata**: Priority, status, progress, dates, and time tracking
6. **Project Integration**: Seamless integration with existing project management

### Technical Architecture
- **Database Layer**: SQLite with optimized queries for hierarchical data
- **API Layer**: RESTful endpoints supporting all CRUD operations
- **Frontend Components**: React-based tree visualization with real-time updates
- **State Management**: Optimized for handling nested data structures

## Business Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### FR1: Task Hierarchy Management
- **Description**: System must support creation and management of 3-level task hierarchies
- **Business Value**: Enables structured project breakdown and improved organization
- **Priority**: Must Have
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Users can create root tasks (Level 1)
  - Users can create sub-tasks under root tasks (Level 2)
  - Users can create detail tasks under sub-tasks (Level 3)
  - System prevents creation beyond Level 3
  - Parent-child relationships are maintained accurately

#### FR2: WBS Code System
- **Description**: Automatic generation of hierarchical WBS codes for task identification
- **Business Value**: Provides clear task identification and structural understanding
- **Priority**: Must Have
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Root tasks receive sequential numbers (1, 2, 3...)
  - Sub-tasks receive parent.sequence format (1.1, 1.2, 2.1...)
  - Detail tasks receive parent.parent.sequence format (1.1.1, 1.2.3...)
  - Codes are automatically generated and cannot be manually edited
  - Codes remain stable throughout task lifecycle

#### FR3: Task Metadata Management
- **Description**: Comprehensive task information including status, priority, progress, and timing
- **Business Value**: Enables effective project tracking and resource planning
- **Priority**: Must Have
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Tasks have status: not_started, in_progress, completed, paused, cancelled
  - Tasks have priority: low, medium, high, urgent
  - Tasks have progress percentage (0-100%)
  - Tasks support start_date and end_date
  - Tasks support estimated_hours and actual_hours tracking
  - Tasks have level_type classification (yearly, half_yearly, quarterly, monthly, weekly, daily)

#### FR4: Visual Tree Interface
- **Description**: Interactive tree visualization with expand/collapse functionality
- **Business Value**: Provides intuitive navigation and overview of project structure
- **Priority**: Must Have
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Tasks displayed in hierarchical tree structure
  - Individual nodes can be expanded/collapsed
  - Bulk expand all/collapse all functionality
  - Visual indicators for task status and priority
  - Progress bars showing completion percentage
  - Responsive design for various screen sizes

#### FR5: Task CRUD Operations
- **Description**: Complete Create, Read, Update, Delete operations for tasks
- **Business Value**: Provides full task lifecycle management
- **Priority**: Must Have
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Users can create new tasks at appropriate levels
  - Users can view task details and hierarchy
  - Users can edit task properties while maintaining hierarchy
  - Users can delete tasks (with constraint checking for children)
  - All operations include proper validation and error handling

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### NFR1: Performance
- **Tree Loading**: Task tree should load within 2 seconds for projects with up to 500 tasks
- **UI Responsiveness**: UI interactions should respond within 200ms
- **Database Queries**: Hierarchical queries optimized for minimal database hits

#### NFR2: Usability
- **Learning Curve**: New users should be able to create their first task within 2 minutes
- **Navigation**: Tree navigation should be intuitive with clear visual hierarchy
- **Error Handling**: Clear, actionable error messages for all failure scenarios

#### NFR3: Data Integrity
- **Referential Integrity**: Parent-child relationships maintained at database level
- **Cascade Rules**: Proper handling of parent deletion scenarios
- **Data Validation**: Server-side validation for all task properties

## Business Rules

### Task Hierarchy Rules
- Maximum 3 levels of task hierarchy (Root → Sub-task → Detail)
- Tasks cannot be created beyond Level 3
- Parent tasks cannot be deleted if they have children
- WBS codes are system-generated and immutable
- Task sort order is maintained within each level

### Status and Progress Rules
- Progress percentage automatically updates to 100% when status changes to 'completed'
- Completed tasks automatically receive completion timestamp
- Status changes are logged for audit purposes
- Progress can only be set between 0-100%

### Time Tracking Rules
- Estimated hours can be set during creation or updated later
- Actual hours are accumulated from time logging activities
- Start and end dates are optional but recommended for planning
- Date validation ensures end_date is not before start_date

## Dependencies and Constraints

### Technical Dependencies
- Existing user authentication system
- Project management module
- SQLite database with hierarchical query support
- React/Next.js frontend framework

### Business Constraints
- Integration with existing project structure
- Backward compatibility with existing time logging
- User permission model alignment
- Data migration considerations for existing projects

### External Dependencies
- No external API dependencies
- Self-contained within existing application architecture

## Implementation Considerations

### Data Migration
- Existing projects will have empty task hierarchies initially
- Migration tools may be needed for bulk task import
- User training required for new WBS concepts

### User Experience
- Progressive disclosure of advanced features
- Contextual help and tooltips for WBS concepts
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Mobile-responsive design considerations

### Scalability
- Efficient handling of large task hierarchies
- Optimized database queries for tree operations
- Lazy loading for large project trees
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements (Post-Sprint 2)
- Task templates and reusable structures
- Gantt chart visualization
- Task dependencies and scheduling
- Bulk operations (import/export)
- Advanced filtering and search
- Task assignment to team members
- Notifications and reminders

### Integration Opportunities
- Calendar integration for scheduling
- Time tracking integration with external tools
- Reporting and analytics dashboard
- Mobile application support
