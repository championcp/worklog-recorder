The testing ensures that all user stories and acceptance criteria are validated, system quality meets business requirements, and integration with existing project management features is seamless.

### 1.2 Scope
The testing scope covers:
- **Functional Testing**: All WBS task CRUD operations, hierarchy management, and metadata handling
- **Integration Testing**: WBS task integration with existing project management system
- **API Testing**: All task-related REST endpoints and data validation
- **UI Testing**: WBSTaskTree component functionality and user interactions
- **Performance Testing**: System responsiveness with various data loads
- **Security Testing**: Authentication, authorization, and data access controls
- **User Acceptance Testing**: End-to-end workflows matching user stories

### 1.3 Test Objectives
1. Verify all Sprint 2 user stories meet their acceptance criteria
2. Ensure WBS task hierarchy (3-level) functions correctly
3. Validate all task metadata (status, priority, progress, dates, hours) handling
4. Confirm API endpoints work correctly with proper validation
5. Verify UI components provide excellent user experience
6. Ensure system performance meets specified benchmarks
7. Validate security controls protect task data appropriately
8. Confirm integration with existing project management features
