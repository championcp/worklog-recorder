- **Dependency Analysis**: Some frontend-backend dependencies not fully mapped upfront

**Impact**: Minor schedule pressure in Week 2, resolved through team collaboration

#### Development Process Gaps
- **Cross-browser Testing**: Started later in sprint than optimal
- **Performance Testing**: Should have been integrated earlier in development cycle
- **Environment Setup**: Test environment setup could have been more streamlined

**Team Quote**: *"We should have caught the tree performance issue earlier with 300+ tasks. Virtual scrolling was the right solution but we could have planned for it."* - Developer A

#### Communication Improvements Needed
- **Technical Complexity**: Some technical decisions could have involved more team discussion
- **Progress Visibility**: Story progress within large tasks could be more granular
- **Stakeholder Updates**: Product Owner wanted more frequent progress updates on complex stories
