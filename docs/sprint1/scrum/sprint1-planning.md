### Sprint Planning Meeting Summary

#### Attendees
- Product Owner (represented by requirements)
- Scrum Master (process facilitation)
- Development Team (single developer)

#### Planning Session Activities

**1. Sprint Goal Definition**
- Reviewed product vision and Sprint 1 objectives
- Confirmed focus on authentication foundation
- Agreed on technical architecture decisions

**2. Story Point Estimation** 
- Used Planning Poker technique for estimation
- Applied Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)
- Considered complexity, effort, and uncertainty
- Account for learning curve on new technologies

**3. Capacity Planning**
- Single developer capacity: 40 story points per week
- 2-week sprint: 80 story points maximum capacity
- Buffer for unknowns: 2 story points
- Sprint commitment: 78 story points

**4. Task Breakdown**
Each user story broken down into technical tasks:
- API endpoint development
- Database operations
- Frontend component development
- Testing and validation
- Documentation updates

#### Risk Assessment During Planning
- **Technical Risk**: New to Next.js 14 app router - allocated extra time
- **Integration Risk**: JWT + cookie authentication pattern - research required
- **Scope Risk**: Authentication scope well-defined, low risk of scope creep

#### Definition of Done Criteria
- Code reviewed and meets quality standards
- Unit tests written and passing
- Integration tests verify functionality
- Documentation updated
- Feature deployed and tested in development environment
- Acceptance criteria validated
- No critical bugs remain
