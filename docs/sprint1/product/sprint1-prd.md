**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User provides unique email address, username (2-20 characters), and password (minimum 6 characters)
- System validates email format using standard regex patterns
- Password is hashed using bcrypt with 12 salt rounds before storage
- Duplicate email addresses are rejected with clear error messaging
- Successful registration automatically logs user in and redirects to dashboard
- Registration generates unique device ID for future synchronization support

### 2. User Authentication System
**Requirement ID:** FR-002  
**Priority:** Must Have (P0)

**Description:** Registered users must be able to securely log into their accounts using email and password credentials.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users authenticate using email/password combination
- Invalid credentials return generic "email or password incorrect" error for security
- Inactive accounts are rejected from login attempts
- Successful login generates JWT token with 7-day expiration
- JWT token stored in HTTP-only cookie with secure flags in production
- Last login timestamp updated upon successful authentication

### 3. Session Management
**Requirement ID:** FR-003  
**Priority:** Must Have (P0)

**Description:** System must maintain secure user sessions and provide session validation capabilities.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- JWT tokens include user ID, email, username, and standard claims (iat, exp)
- Token validation endpoint (/api/auth/me) verifies token and returns user information
- Expired or invalid tokens return 401 Unauthorized status
- Session cookies configured with httpOnly, secure (production), sameSite: strict
- Token validation checks user account status (active/inactive)

### 4. User Logout System
**Requirement ID:** FR-004  
**Priority:** Must Have (P0)

**Description:** Users must be able to securely log out and terminate their sessions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Logout endpoint clears authentication cookie
- Session termination redirects user to login page
- Logged out users cannot access protected resources
- Logout process provides user feedback confirmation

### 5. Protected Route Authentication
**Requirement ID:** FR-005  
**Priority:** Must Have (P0)

**Description:** Application must enforce authentication on protected routes and redirect unauthorized users.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Dashboard and other protected routes verify user authentication
- Unauthenticated users redirected to login page
- Authentication check performed on page load and route navigation
- Loading states displayed during authentication verification

### 6. User Profile Management
**Requirement ID:** FR-006  
**Priority:** Must Have (P0)

**Description:** Authenticated users must be able to view their account information and profile details.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User profile displays username, email, and user ID
- Profile information retrieved from validated JWT token
- Account information displayed in dashboard interface
- User greeting personalization using username
