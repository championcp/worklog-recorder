# Sprint 1 Authentication System - Test Plan

## 🎯 Testing Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Sprint 1 user authentication system of the Nobody Logger application.

### Sprint 1 Scope
- User Registration System
- User Login Authentication
- JWT Token Management
- Session Management with Cookies
- Protected Route Authentication
- User Profile Management
- Logout Functionality
- Security and Data Integrity

## 🏗️ Testing Strategy

### Testing Levels
- **Unit Testing (40%)**: Individual component and service testing
- **Integration Testing (35%)**: API endpoint and database integration
- **End-to-End Testing (20%)**: Complete user workflow validation
- **Security Testing (5%)**: Authentication security and vulnerability assessment

### Testing Approach
- **Risk-Based Testing**: Focus on critical authentication flows
- **Shift-Left Testing**: Early validation in development cycle
- **Automated Testing**: Maximize automation for regression testing
- **Security-First**: Comprehensive security validation

## 📋 Test Scope and Objectives

### In Scope
✅ User registration with validation  
✅ Email/password authentication  
✅ JWT token generation and validation

✅ Protected route authentication  
✅ User logout and session cleanup  
✅ Password security (bcrypt hashing)  
✅ Form validation and error handling  
✅ Database user management  
✅ API endpoint security  

### Out of Scope
❌ Password reset functionality (future sprint)  
❌ Social media authentication (future sprint)  
❌ Multi-factor authentication (future sprint)  
❌ Account lockout policies (future sprint)
