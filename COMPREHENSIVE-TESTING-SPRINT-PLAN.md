# Comprehensive Testing Sprint Plan
## Critical Issue Resolution & System Quality Assurance

### Executive Summary
Based on user feedback indicating insufficient testing and immediate discovery of third-level task expand/collapse issues, this document outlines a systematic testing approach to identify and resolve all functionality gaps before system completion.

### Identified Critical Issues

#### 1. Third-Level Task Hierarchy Expand/Collapse Problem
**Current Issue**: Lines 467-468 in WBSTaskTree.tsx show hardcoded behavior:
```typescript
isExpanded={false} // Child tasks default not expanded
onToggleExpanded={() => {}} // Empty function - no state management
```

**Impact**: Third-level tasks cannot be properly expanded or collapsed, breaking the hierarchical navigation.

#### 2. Insufficient State Management for Nested Nodes
**Problem**: The `expandedNodes` state is only managed at the root level but not propagated to nested TaskNode components.

#### 3. Missing Test Coverage for Critical Paths
**Gap**: Current tests don't cover deep hierarchy interactions, especially expand/collapse at different levels.

## Sprint Overview

**Sprint Duration**: 2 weeks (10 working days)
**Sprint Goal**: Establish comprehensive test coverage and resolve all critical functionality issues
**Definition of Done**: All tests pass, no critical bugs found through systematic testing
